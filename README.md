# Simple Tab Framework

A simple, flexible tab management system built with React and TypeScript. This is intentionally a lightweight framework with no functionality for the actual usage of the tabs; it can be iterated on appropriately.

## Features

- **Multiple Tab Types**: Support for different types of tabs (Home, Data, Settings)
- **Split View**: Create side-by-side views to view two tabs at once
- **Drag and Drop**: Reorder tabs through drag-and-drop
- **Persistent State**: Tab configurations are saved between sessions
